# React boilerplate

This is an opinionated React boilerplate from which to start new projects. The main goal is to have a skeleton that provides a comfortable developer experience building React apps while still being fairly lightweight.

It uses webpack for building, jest with react-testing-library as a test framework, and styled-components for component styling.
